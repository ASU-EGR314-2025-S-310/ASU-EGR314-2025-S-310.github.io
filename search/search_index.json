Utilization of colors, bolding, and verbal direction will allow for easier use of the device. Design interactive controls that are simple, intuitive, and provide clear visual or auditory feedback to minimize user errors and ensure ease of use. Place controls ergonomically and ensure they are durable, accessible, and suitable for both individual and group interactions. Durability and safety are the largest concerns for any potential design concept. The target audience may not understand, or care, how to properly use the exhibit which may lead to injury, the destruction of the exhibit, or both. To combat this, any design must have some sort of failsafe and level of mechanical strengthening to ensure child safety. Instruction should be kept to a minimum and be easily understandable to accommodate the younger end of the target audience. Any necessary instruction will be accommodated with simple, non cluttering labels as well as a human systems approach to the control scheme. To create an effective STEM exhibit, dividing it into smaller, standalone modules can significantly reduce complexity and improve usability. Each module should represent a distinct aspect of the scientific concept, making it easier for users to engage with the exhibit without feeling overwhelmed. The purpose of the exhibit must also be immediately clear and intuitive, which can be achieved by providing visual cues, such as instructional graphics or animations, and auditory feedback that guides users step-by-step. Additionally, incorporating a built-in system to monitor and highlight when components require maintenance ensures the exhibit remains operational and minimizes downtime, as recommended in the guidelines for durable design. To cater to diverse learning styles, the exhibit should use a multisense approach, combining visuals, sounds, and tactile feedback to make the learning experience more engaging and accessible. Finally, interactions should be kept brief and captivating, as younger audiences, such as K-12 students, may have limited attention spans. By following these principles, the exhibit can offer a robust, user-friendly, and inclusive educational experience, as suggested by the readings' emphasis on clear objectives and thoughtful design. The concept sketch will exhibit the concept of magnetism in a way that is fun and interactive. The magnetic ball accelerator will demonstrate this concept while being able to switch direction and speed up or slow down. With controls on acceleration and deceleration the audience can see the concept in action. Color coded buttons and features distinguish capabilities and properties to the audience. The train itself will have bright colors and decals designed to make it noticeable and memorable. There will be infographic and displays of metrics made to further the understanding of the audience.</p>"},{"location":"Ideation%20and%20Concept%20Generation/#video-presentation","title":"Video Presentation","text":"<p>This presentation is out of date.
