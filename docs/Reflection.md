REFLECTION
1. There are many secrets in engineering that no one will tell you, you need to ask questions to find them out.

2. When soldering, make sure to not bridge pins and test, test, test

3. When your designing a pcb make sure that your grounds are grounded and what should be getting power IS getting power and what shouldn't ISN'T. 

4. A big thing with working in a group is that everyone should be comfortable. Its a hard balancing act but it can be done even if you don't know anyone in your group. If you stay within your own bubble you'll never leave it. Having good culture within a group will lead success, being able to have that strife within a group AND it not resort to a pink slip or an anonymous review on one of the CATME's is the backbone to a strong group. Having a bond that deep has helped our team achieve the highest highs and bear through the lowest lows.

5. Teamwork makes the dreamwork, it also makes the prototype functional. The main reason our team was able to achieve a fully functional prototype and it look professional was due to the teamwork ethic we had. Everyone knew exactly what needed to be done and when someone had issues others would be there to help them get through it. This was evident throughout our project as when someone would get done with their part of the project they would go back to help out and as a result our submissions would be polished and quality.

6. There are many ways to skin a cat just like how there are many ways to approach a problem. No two people are the same and their approaches may be wildly different. Having an unbiased view when deciding the best course of action is a very important part of 314 as it can be the difference between having a functional board and failure.
