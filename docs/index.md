    The team will communicate via Text message or Discord and is expected to communicate in a professional 
    and polite way. The team will work hard to be responsive, efficient and timely in all communications 
    in person or otherwise. Instructor correspondence should be summarized to every other member in a 
    clear and concise way. Differing opinions should be settled in a cordial way and any violations of the 
    teams commitment to professionalism and decorum will be called out and reported to the instructor if 
    deemed necessary.

## Conflict Recognition and Resolution

    As a team we agreed that differences in opinion are expected and the healthy and polite discussion is vital to the efficiency and forward motion that the project demands of us. We agreed that definitive project roles and responsibilities are imperative to keeping progress organized and high quality. The team agreed that to resolve any conflict team members should be prepared to apologize and compromise with others in the event of a conflict. Once again professional and considerate discussion is the only tone of discussion permitted, so once this tone has been violated and no intention of reestablishing this tone is in sight then any team member is expected to contact the instructor. The instructor will either serve as a mediator to resolve conflict or pursue disciplinary action against necessary parties.
